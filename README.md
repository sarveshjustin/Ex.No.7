# Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

---

## Apparatus Required  
- Python **3.x**  
- ChatGPT (OpenAI API / Web Interface)  
- Command-Line Interface (CLI) or simple chatbot interface  
- Text editor (VS Code / PyCharm)  
- GitHub for version control and repository upload  

---

## Procedure  

1. **Define Core Requirements**  
   - Daily task management (add, view, delete, prioritize tasks).  
   - Scheduling reminders using natural language.  
   - Suggesting wellness tips.  
   - Answering general queries.  
   - Adaptive response system (preference learning).  

2. **Construct Prompts for Each Feature**  
   - **Task Manager**  
     - “Remind me to call mom at 6 PM.”  
     - “Show me my pending tasks for today.”  
   - **Scheduler**  
     - “Add a meeting with the  team meeting at 9 AM.”  
     - “Do I have any free slots this afternoon?”  
   - **Wellness Tips**  
     - “Give me a quick wellness tip for today.”  
     - “Suggest a short break activity for relaxation.”  
   - **General Queries**  
     - “What’s the weather tomorrow at 9 AM?”  
     - “Summarize my week’s schedule in 3 bullet points.”  

3. **Simulate User Interaction**  
   - Implement a **simple chatbot/CLI** where user inputs queries.  
   - ChatGPT processes the prompt and provides structured outputs.  

4. **Collect Feedback & Adapt Responses**  
   - Example: If the user rejects a wellness suggestion, the assistant adapts next time.  
   - Maintain a **local memory file** (JSON/CSV) for preferences.  

5. **(Optional) Integrate Basic Memory**  
   - Store user interaction data.  
   - Adapt tasks and suggestions automatically in future prompts.

# Result: 

The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal assistant powered by large language models. Students were able to:

 Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to real-life applications.

 Foster creativity by designing features suited to their personal or academic lives.

 Learn prompt engineering techniques for optimal interaction with AI tools.

 Experience the versatility and utility of generative AI in solving everyday problems.
